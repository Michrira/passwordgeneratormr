A password generator for a hw assignment


# A password generator created using JavaScript
This is a password generator created using JS that will generate a password between 8 and 128 characters using lower case, upper case, numeric and special characters to generate a password.

## Description 

This is my first attempt at making a password generator and the only code that I actually wrote for this project was the JavaScript portion. 

(This was a homework assignment that I took on to challenge myself as I am learning to code. Through this assignment, I have furthered my understanding of JavaScript and learning how to code in general.)

## Usage

To use this website, navigate to the "generate password" button, click it and follow the prompts that come up. It will ask how long you want the password to be, if you want to use lower ase, upper case, numeric or special characters and then it will generate a password at the desired length with the inputted prompts.  

(Please feel free to use this code for studying purposes to further your coding knowledge.)
